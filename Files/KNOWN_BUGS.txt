-With controller when you press sign, save/load blocks, keeps triggering when trying to exit chat message.
	(makes it hard to walk away with controller, works fine with keyboard I think)

-Moving DOWN LEFT causes characters animations to stop
	(Probably need to redo how the angles are set for player indicator)
	(or redo how the animations are assigned)
